Better active button system
BUtton interfaces for toggle vs holding stuff

Is it faster to determine steps on the fly or randomize them before hand?
One will hurt framerate the other will hurt loading time



Now all steps post death will be PolarVect(0,0)
Therefore, if an ALIVE dot encounters a copied PolarVect that is 0,0 , it needs to randomize a new step


I need the exponential to base off of the current best, not the overall best possible
